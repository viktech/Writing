## PROJECT DETAILS

### Description
The proposed Photography Darkroom & Film Development Studio would provide Milwaukee MakerSpace members with a dedicated light-controlled environment for developing film and creating photographic prints using traditional analog methods. The area would be divided into a "dry side" for print enlargement and a "wet side" for chemical processing of both film and photographic paper. This facility would initially support black & white process with expansion to color processes, enabling members to explore the full range of analog photography techniques from film development to final print production.

### Purpose & Benefits
*Explain how this workstation/area will benefit the MakerSpace and its members*

- Primary purpose: Provide facilities for film development and darkroom printing that are increasingly difficult to access elsewhere
- Member benefits:
  - Access to specialized equipment without the significant investment of a personal darkroom
  - Ability to learn and practice traditional photographic techniques
  - Complement to existing digital photography capabilities
  - Creative outlet that combines art, chemistry, and craftsmanship
  - Digital hybrid capabilities to bridge traditional and modern techniques
- Skills that can be learned/practiced:
  - Basic black & white film development (initial focus)
  - Darkroom printing fundamentals
  - Advanced techniques as the darkroom capability expands
  - Chemical handling and safety
  - Digital-darkroom hybrid processes
  - Photographic composition and exposure
- Potential for collaboration with other areas:
  - Woodworking (custom frames, pinhole cameras)
  - Electronics (light sensors, custom timers)
  - Screen Printing (combining techniques)
  - Crafting area (photo books, albums)
- Community outreach opportunities:
  - Photography workshops for beginners
  - Youth education in film photography
  - Community art exhibitions
  - Film swap events
  - Collaborative events with local university film labs
  - Various photography-themed community events

### Target Users
*Describe who will use this workstation/area*

- Expected skill levels:
  - Beginner: Learning film development and basic printing
  - Intermediate: Creating custom prints, dodging/burning techniques
  - Advanced: Alternative processes, large format work, color development
- Estimated number of regular users: 5-15 members initially
- Compatibility with other MakerSpace areas: Complements digital media equipment, printmaking, and artistic workspaces
