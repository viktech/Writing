Mr. DeJesus,

I want to deeply and fully apologize for my actions on the Tuesday several weeks ago.

My actions showed deep disrespect towards you.  I disregarded the specific guidelines you gave me, despite the fact that you delivered those guidelines in a courteous and amicable manner.

Furthermore, through proxy, my actions and the events of that day reflect poorly on the institute, and is a betrayal of the opportunity provided by IESI.  I realize it is entirely possible that I will be removed from the program due to my actions. I will take full responsibility and embrace the consequences of my actions.

Finally, the fact that I proturbed a member of the community in such a way is unsettling and causes concern about the decisions I am making and the actions I am taking.  I am practing the reflection and self-analysis that is required to make deep changes in self.

I also need to apologize to the front desk staff for the disturbance I caused.  I need to work towards atonement for all involved including myself, and take steps towards forgiveness .

I have made significant changes during the interim period, and I hope that these changes will reinforce my ability to make positive, productive decisions.  I plan to continue my journey of self-improvement with
