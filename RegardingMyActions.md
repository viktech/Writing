Dear Mr. DeJesus,

I want to deeply and fully apologize for my actions on the Tuesday several weeks ago.

My actions showed deep disrespect towards you.  I disregarded the specific guidelines you gave me, despite the fact that you delivered those guidelines in a courteous and amicable manner.

Furthermore, through proxy, my actions and the events of that day reflect poorly on the Institute, and is a betrayal of the opportunity provided to me by IESI.  I realize it is entirely possible that I will be removed from the program due to my actions. I take full responsibility and embrace the consequences of my actions.

Finally, the fact that I proturbed a member of the community in such a way is unsettling and causes concern about the decisions I am making and the actions I am taking.  I am practing the reflection and self-analysis that is required to make deep changes in myself.

I also need to apologize to the front desk staff for the disturbance I caused.  I will work towards forgiveness, and take steps towards atonement for all involved, including myself.

I have made significant changes during the interim period, and I hope that these changes will reinforce my ability to make positive, productive decisions.  I plan to continue my journey of self-improvement.

Thank you for calling my father.  The actions you took resulted in significant changes in medication, therapy, and providers of care.  I regret that those actions were necessitated by my poor decision-making, rather than through self-improvement and self-discovery.

Please consider this message a step on the path to owning my decisions, and improving the choices I make.

I will be happy to discuss this message, or any related aspect, in person.

Sincerely,

Vikram Shanker
