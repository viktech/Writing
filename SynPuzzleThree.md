The Rescue
You walk through the door.  The positive air pressure slams the door shut behind you.  It cannot be opened from this side.  Always remember to keep keys you find or make.  Keys are some of the most valuable tools.  You left the tool you used to free yourself from your handcuffs behind you. 

You take a step into the dim room.  Your foot knocks over a half-empty soda can.  The dark liquid spills out and seeps into the carpet. 

You realize there is a person curled up in the corner. One of their arms is handcuffed to a very heavy, cast-iron steam radiator.  They have already tried to free themselves.  During their attempts, the handcuff tightened and is now digging into their wrist.  A closer look reveals a brand and model: "Smith & Wesson 100."
