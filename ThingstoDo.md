Milwaukee Public Library Central on Wisconsin Ave

-a beautiful marble architecture in the Renaissance style, with regularly curated collections and an extensive catalog.  Great ambiance, it's always a good vibe, even if just for the afternoon 

Milwaukee Public Market

-An indoor open market with an emphasis on local and fresh.  Particularly good fish and cheesemongers, a spice vendor, and a nice little wine bar among other little eateries.  Gets very busy during peak hours, a testament to its quality.

Milwaukee Art Museum

-One of the iconic structures of Milwaukee's skyline, with the main body of the building featuring an atrium overlooking Milwaukee's greatest natural resource, and the wings featuring an extensive and diverse permanent collection.  It's usually worth going a couple times a year because their temporary exhibitions are aesthetic and thoughtful
