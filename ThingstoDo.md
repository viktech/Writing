Milwaukee Public Library Central on Wisconsin Ave

-a beautiful marble architecture in the Renaissance style, with regularly curated collections and an extensive catalog.  Great ambiance, it's always a good vibe, even if just for the afternoon 

Milwaukee Public Market

-An indoor open market with an emphasis on local and fresh.  Particularly good fish and cheesemongers, a spice vendor, and a nice little wine bar among other little eateries.  Gets very busy during peak hours, a testament to its quality.
