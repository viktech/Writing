TOOL at the Fiserv Forum on November 1st.

https://youtu.be/FssULNGSZIA Danny Carey playing Pneuma (I like this because it has good audio and doesn't give the show away)

https://youtu.be/rEfS-GkSWMQ TOOL song being covered by some young musicians (and some old guy having too much fun)

https://youtu.be/fScQo9jA9VI Old TOOL. It's said that Maynard moved behind the band during live shows because he loves watching Danny play.
