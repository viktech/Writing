Outside of my four family and my dwindling few friends, I would like to relay my thanks to RN Neil at Dewey for, among other things, significantly improving my ability to resist periods of self-degradation without substances. A big thanks to RN Mike at Dewey who greatly contributed to my research (and gave me some banger tunes.) I have great gifts in mind for both of them, I just don't have the budget. Dr Longo will likely know them both. I have not met Dr., but I have seen and heard how others speak of him.   

I feel that PA Geoffrey Watters changed a lot for me in my go-through of PHP 2. He didn't particularly seem to acknowledge me when I was at Dewey the second time for IOP RED, which made me kind of sad. I've gained weight in my recovery. Maybe I wasn't recognized. It may just be his demeanor, and I'm happy to see him again all the same. He has a lot of faces to attend to. I wish Dr Longo well and thank him for his gift of the art I meditated upon in Dewey's green space during my breaks. 

I want to give great gifts for the front desk and cafe staff at Dewey Center, too. They helped a huge amount. I know there are others. Maybe one day I will be in a position to contribute a gift for all to enjoy.

PHP Olivia Wenzel has moved on from Dewey, but she provided an exceptional experience. I hope she herself, and know the individuals she is tasked with, are well.
