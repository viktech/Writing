## **EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS**
*(Because ADHD means sometimes we need backup plans)*

**If you're stuck:**
1. Pick the smallest next task
2. Set 25-minute timer
3. Just start with equipment setup
4. Call your business partner

**If overwhelmed:**
1. Focus on ONE demo only
2. Book just ONE venue
3. Run just ONE event
4. Then reassess

**Daily focus question:**
*"What's the ONE thing I can do today to move this forward?"*

## **YOUR NEXT 3 ACTIONS**
1. **TODAY**: Register business name online (Wisconsin DFI website, takes 20 minutes)
2. **TOMORROW**: Order WiFi Pineapple from Hak5
3. **THIS WEEK**: Text one venue owner you know to gauge interest
