Hello Robert.

Remember talking shit about me at the barbecue joint?
Bit of fun having a laugh, shit talking me?

You lost me a job, Robert.  And now it's my turn to have fun.

I've recorded a 3 part album I'm going to release on Spotify, a YouTube music video drop, and choreographed a live performance to perform every week at all the places you love.  
It's about you.  It's called "Robert Brooks Is a Bitch." I even produced the banger backing tracks. And ive even got stickers with your face on them!

I'm going to call you a bitch, Robert, harder than you can even contemplate.

Do you like my album art?  It's fit for a diehard snitch.  Do you like my laser?  I can make it 9 times bigger ðŸ™ƒ maybe I will for parts two and three!

You could have gone about your day, Robert.  But you stopped to kick the sleeping giant.  I'm going to make it so everybody who looks at you is laughing at you behind your back.  I'm going to make it so people you don't know recognize you as the bitch snitch from the song.  After all, I got a lot of free time without a job.

I hope you have just a terrible, awful day.  And then I hope your terrible days get worse, release by release, by release. I hope to never see you again, and you're going to wish people couldn't see you either.  Watch me commit a murder ðŸ‘¹
