  Mr RN Neil,

It is always a pleasure to see you.  I'm happy to see that your care is distributed throughout the complex.

I have two projects I'm working on that I'd like your help with, if you are open to helping.

The first is an art project slash safety tool for people going through the acute care process.  It stems from the fact that such a tool would have significantly aided me during my most recent health crisis.  It is driven by the pointlessness of the art project we did do in session - I feel like there is a gap between the "safety plan" and functional safety.  Making slight modifications to the existing art project could significantly improve the work product.

The second project is a personal one that stems from some advice you gave me, combined with some feedback from Dr Gagrat.  He assessed me for an autism spectrum disorder and concluded that it is likely that I have this disorder.  It doesn't change anything, but it does explain why certain things, particularly socially and interpersonally, are chronically challenging for me. These things include reaching out to others, and letting others in.  

I am trying to develop strategies or techniques to allow me to practice these things.  However, they are naturally challenging to me, so I'm having trouble self-identifying steps to improve or exercises to practice.
