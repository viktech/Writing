Dr. Ray,

Thank you so much for the advice and guidance you provided as I navigated my mental health challenges.

The PHP program was incredibly helpful - Despite the relatively short length of the program, all my concerns and needs were addressed.

As usual, the Aurora staff were very kind, greeted me with a smile every morning, and facilitated communication with the doctor.

Seeing the doctor every two days was really cool.  It allowed for expeditious medication management, which is a godsend considering the challenges I've been facing.

I am most grateful for the administrative staff who helped me get scheduled through central scheduling with a Dr Temme in December.  

Following that, she reached out internally and was able to reschedule me for Sept 7th.  I am so grateful for that.

I want to contribute back to the Mental Health program, and find opportunities to support patients and staff.  I'm working on some ideas to do just that. 

Dr. Gagrat had excellent bedside manner and was thorough, knowledgable, and engaged.

Just as I send a well-wish to you when I walk into the building for getting me to the step of MH PHP, I will send a well-wish to Dr. Gagrat every time I go into Lorton for getting me to the step of quality long-term outpatient care.

I am now in high spirits, very hopeful, amd looking forward to the future.

You rock for taking the time to advocate for a patient.  We are all grateful for Professionals like you.
