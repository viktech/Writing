It's a rigid shovel it's gonna leak maybe not from the engine but that 4 speed output shaft seal will always leak It's gonna beat you to death but it's a rigid it's supposed too,that's what loctit,star lock washers and nyloc nuts are for buy plenty üòÜ Straight weight oil 50 when it's cold out 70 wgt when it's hot outside cause you can't run synthetic or you will own an expensive great looking mosquito fogger Piston ring clearance is too loose to run synthetic on the pre- evolution motors so Straight weight only!!!!! You can run 20w50 in the summer but 70w is best BUY A HARLEY BIBLE (service manual) And know it well it's your best friend I normally don't recommend anything strictly HD aftermarket but the Bible is better as a factory manual normally around 35 usd Enjoy the hell outta that machine I've still got 2 trouble heads and love'em

Well the obvious is ‚Ä¶ choppers are sketchy. Even good ones are kinda bad. For that bike, keep it clean so you know when and where it starts to leak from. I think maintenance looks like oil changes every 2500-3500 miles or every 6 months depending on how you plan to ride it. Keep a spare set of spark plugs around. Learn and know how to take apart and rebuild carbs. Also, you need to know that it isn‚Äôt going to turn around in a gas station very easily, U turns in the road ‚Ä¶ good luck. But cruising with some chopper buddies feels like flying with eagles. You‚Äôll be the coolest bike on the road for sure. Every other biker with a stock bike will either hate you or envy you. Ride choppers and be free! Keep choppers sketchy!

Oh just a side thought, see if you can find an old jammers handbook. They were classic chopper gold of the day. They can help you sort out some electrical gremlins as well as show you the parts that are out there from the 70s if you look hard enough. Choppers are great just gotta keep an eye on them and don‚Äôt let them sit for too long.

Choppers break, girders are bouncy, no front brake, loud af most likely, not alot of gas, might leake, personally geometry in long bikes really matter but most build them off looks alone and then wonder why they ride like shit. Also solid mounted everything makes things rattle loose

Yeah‚Ä¶ difficult cornering and potholes/uneven pavement. A 65 mph pothole could very easily send you pavement surfing if you‚Äôre not an experienced rider. I ended up body surfing the pavement at around 50 mph back in the 80‚Äôs and it fuckin sux. Thank the gods for leather:)
Rigid frame? Get yourself a back brace lol. An afternoon of potholes and you‚Äôll be scheduling back surgery in the not too distant future.
Someone has already mentioned the lack of a front brake which is normally around 70% of your stopping power. I need new glasses but that looks like a drum brake on the back? If it is that further diminishes your stopping power. You can‚Äôt really stomp on a drum and expect it to grab pavement in an emergency. I‚Äôve had a few situations where using just my rear brake allowed me to skid in a straight line between two cars that both stopped directly in front of me. You‚Äôre going to really need to rely on down shifting/jake braking for control.
Sweet ride! But I would take the other advice shared here and get some practice time in before hitting the city. I would find someone to help you if you can‚Ä¶ a few tips and tricks for both riding and maintenance can go a long way.
It‚Äôs cool that you intend to ride it more than that one long ride from the back of a trailer to the bar at some rally. Have a blast!!

Whoa, stand up scooter to a chopper! Yipes, that's some crazy transition. I'd not only get familiar with the engine, but with the bikes handling.. Those bikes arent built to go very fast. They can but will shake themselves to pieces. You are setting a high bar for yourself, stating you're going to ride through the city and stop and talk. First off, are you allowed to split lanes? Second, i can't see very well but i don't think you have a front brake. Do some serious practice because first off, that's a show bike, so it has very little miles on it. It's been sitting, so you've gotta work the bugs out. Also, you're used to the snap acceleration of an electric engine. You're not getting that on a shovel. Maintenence wise, it depends on your riding habits. Use heavyweight straight oil if you can, i run straight 50w in my 69 flh. Oil change every 3000ish. Clean regularly which will help you identify loose parts because you should get a tube of lock tite for your garage to tighten the commonly loosening nuts. Enjoy it but realize you're dealing with a slow lumbering beast that needs a few to get out of its own way... have fun!

Would strongly recommend getting an FSM. Here's a link to .pdf copies of damn near every FSM, and they're free. (Everyone who needs one should have a look.)
For that one, I'd do a search for this manual. It's in there. Just scroll down through all the owners manuals and the FSMs are at the bottom.
"Harley Davidson Service Manual 1970 to 1978.pdf"
Harley Service Manuals and Owners Guides
Oil is the lifeblood of old iron like that. Get ready to check it religiously. Before taking it out on any lengthy rides, make sure you've got all your basic wrench sizes for fasteners on the bike, and carry some extra wire with butt spliced connections already on them, e tape or chassis tape, extra plugs, baling wire, zip ties, steel zips, tube and tire plug/patch kit, intake manifold Orings, and I'm a fan of running an additional fuel bottle as well.
Check outdoor consignment stores and look for MSR fuel bottles. They're pressure rated, designed for fuel, and can usually be had for $5-$10 in the used market.
Also, give yourself PLENTY of stopping distance. No front brake robs you of around 70% of your braking power. Those old drum brakes will work, but you'll need to get comfy with using the engine for braking as well.
If you want a super in-depth book that's also an easy read and has all the technical tips and tricks from a gray beard, check out Donnys Unauthorized Technical Guide Vol. 5 1966-1985 The Shovelhead Part 1 and Part 2.
Those books are both around 700 pages of tips, tricks, tunes, modifications, and every other thing you can think of.
Also, keep a close eye on the bushings for that girder. I swapped mine out with some SS dogbones and Timken bearings so it stays tight on my Fury.
Thanks for coming to my wall of text TED talk. Best of luck out there man. That's a sweet scoot.

The bike is a Shovelhead set in a hardtail frame. No front fender. It‚Äôs basically a bar bike. It‚Äôs possible to take it on a 1000 mile trip, but it will be brutal. Hard tails have zero riding comfort. And if you hit rain, the bike is near useless.
Maintaining a shovel will be a chore. They are far from engineering marvels. Hopefully, the electrical is sorted out. Many refer to the shovel head as a trouble head. There is a reason for the connotation.

Funny. I grew up in MKE but split for the desert in the mid eighties, a few years after high school when I woke up one -35 morning and realized that I was an adult and could live anywhere I wanted to, and I didn‚Äôt want to live there anymore. I have almost year round riding where I am now, but I second the comment about there being no front fender. I went with a Springer on my Sportster a while back and it totally improved the ride and looks cool as shit‚Ä¶. and then I got caught in the rain and the water, rocks, and dirt were coming straight off the tire and into my face. I also made a short rear fender by cutting an old one and made it just a little too short, so the water, rocks, and dirt came straight off the tire into my ass crack, so I was getting it on both ends lol. I found a really nice little ‚ÄúTop Hat‚Äù fender and mounted it on the front and that did the trick. Still, I don‚Äôt think I would ride yours in the rain, especially with that brake setup.
And good on ya for staying sober. The first almost 5 years that I rode I had no problems, but then I started doing more drugs and drinking and my judgment started to slip even when I was straight, and I had three progressively worse accidents in one year. So I thought and meditated on it real hard because I either had to give up the drugs or the bike, so I traded the bike and a 58 Chevy pickup for A Lot Of Drugs. It sounds dumb, but I must‚Äôve made the right choice because I‚Äôm still alive lol. I also got the Sportster I ride now as a sober present for myself.

You will definitely need a bag of some kind handlebar or sissybar for start, with tools wrenches, pliers, wire, tape, you will figure out what else. Basics mostly for tightening up the things that vibrate loose. Awesome bike for sure, eventually you will find people you will want to ride with even if it‚Äôs just 1 or 2. Remember it‚Äôs the journey not the destination. Choppers some of my best memories

I went from never riding a motorcycle or a dirt bike in my life to learning how to ride a chopper just like this one with this exact springer front end to daily-ing it in juts under 4 months. I daily it through traffic in a city Iv never had an issue with the free ways or busy/fast roads. Im extremely comfortable on it I would just say make sure you know your stopping distance because obviously you have no front brake point. Also I would be careful accelerating to hard out of sharp corners its hard to explain but the wheel sometimes doesn‚Äôt want to go strait. Im not exaggerating every time I ride someone honks at me and gives me a thumbs up or a head nod with a smile. Its loud, its leaks, things rattle, I have a-lot of fun

Don‚Äôt ride in the rain, no front fender. Ride slow leave plenty of room, no front brake and one drum brake. Keep tools with you. Everything rattles loose on a hard tail.

Always check the oil, tighten every thing down after and before every ride, and be prepared to be constantly wrenching on it.

Adjust the pushrods/check them every so often. Make sure it has oil and check for oil pressure. Check the transmission fluids every once in a while. Make sure to do a wheelie

It's got no front brake, and the rear is the old drum, which is far less effective than a good disc setup.
Riding you're going to spend a lot of time thinking ahead because you're going to need to start braking sooner.
What kind of riding you're going to be doing will make a big difference as to whether or not that becomes much of an issue.
I did it while in a bike club, where protocol was 18 inches between your front tire and the guy in front of you's back tire, and always at speeds at least 20mph over the speed limit. Stressful TBH, but I never did crash on that bike, so the fact that I'm still alive is proof it's doable.
If you're riding to shows or something on a liesurly Sunday afternoon it's fine. Friday night shitfaced with the boys and riding like an animal...just remember you've got limitations.

This bike has all the stuff I used when I was young and building bikes(In the 70‚Äôs). Invader wheels, Peanut tank, KingQueen seat with sissy bar. Pike top risers holding the short ape handlebars, kick out dual pipes(I have a new set like those still in the plastic out in my garage). Seeing this one makes me ‚Äúalmost‚Äù want to put another one together. I still have a half of a garage full of old school chopper parts and tons of ironhead sportster stuff too.

Listen, there is no almost about it. Build more choppers. Custom bikes need to flood the market. I‚Äôm sick of seeing the same shitty black Harley bagger with 30k in motor work so fat guys can think they are hard‚Ä¶ 60s and 70s chopper are what made motorcycles cool. Build the damn thing, learn about it, ride it, fix it, ride it some more. Where are the choppers where are the custom bikes!?! Teach the young cats how to chop. It‚Äôs the only way to keep it kool.

I love choppers but if it is as long as it looks and no front brake! it will be murder to ride and steer !!!
