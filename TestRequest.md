I have a feeling I'm on the autism spectrum. Somebody else who has that diagnosis said my actions reminded me of theirs. I told a previous provider, and was told that it wasn't worth getting assessed because it wouldn't affect treatment.
 
I asked my doctor to be put on ariprazole because of my independent research finding the studied effect it had on cormid diagnoses I have and the potential effect it has on symptoms of ASD that I identify with, and was prescribed it. Injections were the most regular, and I seemed to be the most emotionally accessible and socially stable on them, but it was during the pandemic so that has no good evidence. 
 
I experienced significant weight gain suddenly after some time on it and discontinued its use, or I stopped taking the medication and experienced significant weight gain. I don't remember the order. I understand psychiatric charting is not available to patients. Please correlate my charted weight increase to prescribing changes and let me know.
 
I'd like to be assessed for the aforementioned disorder. Let me know if this is possible.
