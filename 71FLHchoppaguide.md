# INTRODUCTION & OVERVIEW

## ABOUT THIS GUIDE

This comprehensive guide has been compiled based on the 1970-78 Harley-Davidson Electra/Super Service Manual provided by Sunnymead Cycles, expert rider input, the Jammer's Handbook, and real-world experience with modified Shovelhead choppers. It is designed to provide owners of rigid-frame Shovelhead choppers with the specific information needed to maintain, troubleshoot, and safely operate these custom motorcycles.

While factory service manuals provide valuable baseline information, the modifications common to choppers often require different maintenance approaches and create unique operating characteristics. This guide bridges that gap by addressing the specific needs of chopper enthusiasts.

As noted by Sunnymead Cycles: *"Keep the shiny side up and the rubber side down!"*

## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR MODIFIED CHOPPERS

Chopper modifications significantly change the handling, maintenance requirements, and operational characteristics of your Shovelhead. Key considerations include:

1. **Rigid Frame**: No rear suspension means road vibrations transfer directly to the rider and all components, increasing wear on fasteners and requiring more frequent tightening.

2. **Extended Frontend**: Altered rake and trail geometry changes handling characteristics, requiring different riding techniques and reduced cornering speeds.

3. **Single Brake System**: Most choppers rely solely on the rear drum brake, requiring greatly increased stopping distances and forward planning.

4. **Custom Fuel Tanks**: Often smaller capacity tanks require more frequent refueling and attention to fuel reserves.

5. **Modified Electrical Systems**: Simplified or customized wiring requires special attention to connections and grounding.

6. **Belt Primary Drives**: Different maintenance requirements than chain drives, with special attention to tension and alignment.

7. **Ergonomics**: Modified rider position affects handling and comfort, sometimes requiring adjustment periods.

## ORIGINAL OWNER COMMENTS

Multiple experienced riders have contributed insights, including:

> *"It's a rigid shovel it's gonna leak maybe not from the engine but that 4 speed output shaft seal will always leak. It's gonna beat you to death but it's a rigid it's supposed too, that's what Loctite, star lock washers and nyloc nuts are for... Straight weight oil ONLY!"* - Dobermansrule

> *"Choppers are sketchy. Even good ones are kinda bad... oil changes every 2,500-3,500 miles or every 6 months depending on how you plan to ride it. Keep a spare set of spark plugs around. Learn and know how to take apart and rebuild carbs."* - ChopperheadTed

> *"...difficult cornering and potholes/uneven pavement. A 65 mph pothole could very easily send you pavement surfing if you're not an experienced rider... Thank the gods for leather."* - Candy_Says1964

> *"Everything rattles loose on a hard tail."* - Nasty5727

These real-world observations inform many of the maintenance recommendations in this guide.

# CRITICAL COMPONENT ADJUSTMENTS

## VALVE ADJUSTMENT PROCEDURE
1. Ensure engine is cold (min. 4 hours since running)
2. Remove spark plugs
3. Remove rocker box covers
4. Rotate engine to TDC compression stroke for cylinder being adjusted
5. Check clearance with feeler gauge (0.002"-0.004")
6. Adjust as needed:
   - Loosen locknut
   - Turn adjusting screw to set clearance
   - Hold adjusting screw while tightening locknut
   - Recheck clearance after tightening
7. Repeat for second cylinder
8. Install rocker box covers with new gaskets
9. Install spark plugs

## IGNITION TIMING PROCEDURE
1. Connect timing light to front cylinder
2. Warm engine to operating temperature
3. Locate timing marks on flywheel (located in inspection hole)
4. With engine at idle (900-1000 RPM), timing mark should align with "F" mark
5. At approximately 2000 RPM, timing should advance to 35° mark
6. If adjustment needed:
   - Loosen breaker plate mounting screws
   - Rotate plate counter-clockwise to advance timing
   - Rotate plate clockwise to retard timing
   - Tighten mounting screws
   - Recheck timing
7. Verify timing advance operates smoothly as RPM increases

## CARBURETOR ADJUSTMENT SEQUENCE
1. Warm engine to operating temperature
2. Set idle speed screw for 900-1000 RPM
3. Adjust idle mixture screw:
   - Turn screw in until engine begins to run poorly
   - Note position
   - Turn screw out until engine begins to run poorly
   - Note position
   - Set screw halfway between these positions
4. Readjust idle speed as needed
5. Test acceleration:
   - Quick throttle opening should produce immediate response
   - Hesitation indicates too lean
   - Bogging indicates too rich
6. Fine-tune mixture if needed for smooth acceleration

## BELT PRIMARY ADJUSTMENT
1. **Checking Belt Tension**:
   - Place bike on center stand or suitable support
   - Belt should have 1/2" to 3/4" deflection at center point
   - Too tight: potential bearing damage
   - Too loose: slipping and premature wear

2. **Adjustment Procedure**:
   - Loosen adjuster locknut
   - Turn adjuster screw to achieve proper tension
   - Tighten locknut while holding adjuster in position
   - Rotate engine and recheck tension at multiple points

3. **Alignment Check**:
   - Belt should run centered on both pulleys
   - Check with straightedge along pulleys
   - Adjust as needed with shims

## CLUTCH ADJUSTMENT
1. **Lever Free Play**:
   - Correct free play: 1/8" to 1/4" at lever
   - Adjust at handlebar adjuster first
   - Fine-tune at clutch cable bracket if needed

2. **Clutch Cable Lubrication**:
   - Disconnect cable at both ends
   - Lubricate with cable lubricant
   - Work lubricant through by sliding cable housing

3. **Internal Adjustment** (if necessary):
   - Remove primary cover
   - Adjust clutch release rod (0.030"-0.060" free play)
   - Check friction disc thickness (replace if less than service limit)
   - Verify spring tension is equal on all springs

## CYLINDER HEAD BOLT TIGHTENING SEQUENCE
1. Start with center bolts
2. Work outward in crossing pattern
3. Tighten to 35-36 ft-lbs in three stages (15, 25, 35 ft-lbs)
4. Recheck after first heat cycle

# CHOPPER-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS

## FRAME & GEOMETRY MODIFICATIONS

### FRAME MODIFICATIONS
| Modification | Stock Specification | Chopper Range | Considerations |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Neck Rake | 30° | 35-45° | Increases handling stability at speed, decreases low-speed maneuverability |
| Wheel Base | 61.5" | 72-84" | Longer wheelbase reduces quick turning ability but increases highway stability |
| Seat Height | 31.5" | 26-30" | Lower seat heights improve stability but can reduce ground clearance |
| Trail | 4.0" | 6-8" | Increased trail provides stronger self-centering at speed |
| Ground Clearance | 5.5" | 4-5" | Reduced clearance requires attention to road obstacles |
| Triple Tree Rake | 0° | 0-5° | Additional rake in trees compounds handling effects |

### FRONTEND GEOMETRY 
| Component | Stock | Springer/Girder | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Length | 28.5" | 32-42" | Extended length affects all handling aspects |
| Construction | Hydraulic fork | Rigid springer/girder | No hydraulic damping available |
| Steering Dampener | Optional | Recommended | Helps control high-speed wobble |
| Neck Bearings | Tapered roller | Tapered roller | Critical to maintain proper adjustment |
| Braking Effect | Dive under braking | Minimal geometry change | Due to rigid construction |

### RIGID FRAME CHARACTERISTICS
- **Stress Points**: Monitor welds at neck, lower motor mounts, and axle plates
- **Flex Characteristics**: Some flex in frame is normal under power or in turns
- **Critical Areas**: Frame stretch welds require regular inspection
- **Maintenance Focus**: Neck bearings critical for handling and safety
- **Vibration Management**: Use rubber mounting for components where possible

## HANDLING CHARACTERISTICS

### TURNING & CORNERING
- **Turning Radius**: Approximately 2-3 times larger than stock
- **Countersteering**: More pronounced input required at speed
- **Cornering Speed**: 1/2 to 2/3 that of a comparable stock motorcycle
- **Lean Angle**: Reduced compared to stock due to rigid frame flex
- **Low-Speed Maneuvers**: Extremely challenging - practice in empty areas

### STOPPING & BRAKING
- **Single Brake Limitation**: 70% reduction in stopping power compared to dual-brake systems
- **Stopping Distance**: 2-3 times normal distances required
- **Brake Fade**: Heat buildup occurs more quickly with single brake
- **Emergency Braking**: Plan escape routes due to limited braking power
- **Downhill Braking**: Use engine braking to supplement rear brake

### HIGH-SPEED STABILITY
- **Extended Wheelbase Benefits**: Better straight-line stability
- **Crosswind Sensitivity**: Greater due to altered geometry
- **Suspension Action**: None with rigid frame - all impacts transmitted to rider
- **Highway Tracking**: Can follow road grooves or crown
- **Speed Wobble Management**: Proper neck bearing adjustment critical

## TIRE & WHEEL SPECIFICATIONS

### TIRE CONSIDERATIONS
- **Front Tire**: MT90-16CV / 5.00-16T or 5.10-16T
  - Critical for steering response with extended frontend
  - Maintain proper pressure (21 PSI for 210 lb rider)
  - Check condition frequently - most of steering response comes from front tire

- **Rear Tire**: MT90-16CV / 5.00-16T or 5.10-16T
  - Sole source of braking traction
  - Maintain proper pressure (25 PSI for 210 lb rider)
  - Wear accelerates due to rigid frame and single-brake setup

### WHEEL CONSIDERATIONS  
- **Spoke Tension**: Check frequently - rigid frame transmits more shock to wheels
- **Bearing Maintenance**: More frequent service intervals recommended
- **Rim Runout**: Check for trueness regularly
- **Custom Wheels**: Verify load rating appropriate for rider weight and rigid application

- **Heat**: Air-cooled engines run hot by design - not necessarily an indication of problems

## MODIFICATION CONSIDERATIONS
- **Ignition Upgrade Options**: Electronic ignition provides more reliable starting and better performance
- **Carburetor Choices**: S&S Super E or B often provides better performance than stock
- **Oil System Enhancements**: External oil filter adaptors highly recommended
- **Transmission Options**: Later 5-speed can be retrofitted with modifications
- **Frame Modifications**: Hardtail conversion requires proper engineering for safety

## FINAL THOUGHTS
The 1971 Shovelhead represents a classic era in American motorcycle history. When properly maintained and respected for its unique characteristics, it can provide thousands of miles of reliable service. Its air-cooled simplicity and mechanical nature make it an ideal platform for learning motorcycle mechanics and experiencing the raw essence of motorcycling.

While chopper modifications add character and style, they also create specific handling and maintenance requirements that must be understood for safe operation. This guide aims to provide the essential knowledge needed to keep your chopper running at its best while preserving its distinctive character.
