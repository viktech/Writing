I like you and I trust you.  I learn best by teaching others, but I've realized I'm a tutor, not a teacher.  I've always been in the practice of learning and practicing, and was taught to help others for practice.

I don't like to teach people I don't think I can trust. I can deduce, through reasoning using formal logic, that others also may not think they can trust those people.  

I make the logical proposition that some people, such as the people who I don't like to teach, may not help others.

See how useful this is?  It allows one to express thoughts accurately, and therefore enables the presentation of logically valid and logically sound arguments.  Sometimes, the arguments can even be proven!

Arguing the validity of a proposition through a step by step process is called a proof.

Your homework is to consider the following.

Out of all people, there exist some people that may not help others. I am a person, and I do not like to teach all people. Am I a person that may not help others?

We will practice arguing using your conclusion in the next lesson.  Class is dismissed!
