Look, Bryan!  A process you helped foster is growing through iterative brute-force!

My Twitter account is old af. when I found a use for the technology, I used tweets to document on and off times for work sites with embeds to identify the job for tracking and billing for my small business.  I thought people were dumb because they used twitter in a different way, betraying more privacy than needed to while making errant transmissions that corroborated metadata

We we both right.
