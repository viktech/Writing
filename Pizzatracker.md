# Pizza Kitchen Management System
## Streamlining Orders from Counter to Customer

### Executive Summary

We propose implementing a custom-built digital ticket management system to eliminate the current paper ticket chaos and provide real-time order tracking across all three kitchen stations. This system will be operational within 3 weeks at minimal cost, running on equipment we already own or can purchase for under $500.

### The Current Problem

**What's Happening Now:**
- Orders from front counter, DoorDash, and UberEats are manually copied onto paper tickets
- No visibility when orders are ready or delayed
- Kitchen staff can't communicate status back to counter
- No way to track which station has which order
- Peak hours (15 pizzas/hour) create ticket pile-ups and confusion

**Impact on Operations:**
- Lost tickets leading to remakes and customer complaints  
- Counter staff constantly walking to kitchen to check order status
- Delivery drivers waiting without updates
- Stressed staff during rush periods
- No data on actual prep times or bottlenecks

### Our Solution: Digital Kitchen Display System

**How It Works:**

1. **Order Entry Station** (Front Counter)
   - Single tablet for entering walk-in orders
   - Automatic import of DoorDash/UberEats orders
   - All orders flow to one organized queue
   - No more handwritten tickets to lose

2. **Pizza Line Display** 
   - Shows next 6 orders to prepare
   - Color-coded by wait time (green → yellow → red)
   - One-touch to mark pizza ready for oven
   - Clear view of special modifications

3. **Finishing Station Display**
   - Automatic 10-minute oven timer per pizza
   - Visual + audio alerts when pizzas are ready
   - One-touch to mark order complete
   - Counter gets instant notification

### Implementation Plan

**Week 1:** Basic system setup and order entry
**Week 2:** Kitchen displays and timer functions  
**Week 3:** Staff training and practice runs
**Week 4:** Go-live with full support

**What We Need:**
- 3 tablets or monitors (one per station) - $450 if purchasing new
- 1 mini PC to run the system - $300 or use existing computer
- Existing WiFi network
- 4 hours of training time per staff member

### Why Custom Instead of Commercial?

**Commercial Systems:**
- $5,000-15,000 upfront cost
- $200-500 monthly fees
- Require cloud connectivity
- Generic features not designed for pizza operations
- Long implementation times (2-3 months)

**Our Custom System:**
- Under $1,000 total investment
- No monthly fees
- Works on local network (no internet required)
- Built specifically for our 3-station pizza workflow  
- Operational in 3 weeks

---

### Risk Mitigation

**"What if it breaks?"**
- System runs locally - internet outages don't affect operations
- Automatic backup every 30 minutes
- Paper ticket fallback always available
- Simple restart procedures documented for all staff

**"What if staff can't learn it?"**
- Designed simpler than smartphone apps
- Visual design requires minimal reading
- Hands-on training for every team member
- Gradual rollout - start with one station

---

### Next Steps

1. **Management Review** - Confirm feature priorities and timeline
2. **Staff Input Session** - Gather feedback on current pain points
3. **Hardware Assessment** - Inventory existing equipment
4. **Development Start** - Begin building core order flow
5. **Training Schedule** - Plan sessions around shift schedules

### Summary

This system transforms our kitchen from paper chaos to digital efficiency without breaking the budget or disrupting operations. By building it ourselves, we get exactly what we need—nothing more, nothing less—and can modify it as we grow. 

Most importantly, it makes everyone's job easier: kitchen staff see orders clearly, counter staff know exactly when orders are ready, and management gets the data needed to continuously improve operations.

**Total Investment: Under $1,000**  
**Implementation Time: 3 weeks**  
**Payback Period: 60 days through improved efficiency**
