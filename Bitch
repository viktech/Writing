hello world 
V I K T E C H

Robert Brooks junior 
is a whole 
ass 
bitch 
felon, thief, pussy snitch 
Coward can't keep his mouth shut 
pretty normal for a cocaine slut
Open your mouth about me to talk shit?
Watch what I do about it,
nigga die to regret it

This is a murder 
with words with bars with beats
I paved a new road for /you/
A road less traveled and 
i left you footsteps cured in concrete
to guide you to reality in rain, 
sleet or snow, the powder you blow 
My words will snipe you dead, 
see your blood fill them, white stained red
as youre killed by my lyrical soliloquy 
just wait for part two of the trilogy 

Let's count the things you got 
Homeless nigga got a roof a job
a room a car a phone 
Lent a computer a kitchen a home 
Found a girlfriend, got off parole 
Nigga Had a friend that had your back 
Threw it away, goofy acting wack

Cause youre a
Little 
Hopalong 
Bitch 

is it smart, fucking with a hacker? (No)
cocaine done rotted your brain, stupid slacker (yeah)
we were friends once I wanted you to succeed 
but i dont keep snitches in need 
in my heart (no) you live in a file 
dropped on the net (yeah)
for anyone and all to see
That you are untrustworthy 

Cause Robert Brooks is a bitch 

Driving my car ASC-2113
If you see him let him have it 
I see you Still have your booze habit
Followed you from the liquor store 
I see you like the falcon watching the rabbit 
Lets you run from tree to tree to tree
thinking you found safety Before 
my talons rip you open And My beak 
sets your head Free from your spine 
For dropping a dime 

Cause Robert Brooks is a bitch

is it smart, fucking with a hacker
cocaine must have rotted your brain
we were friends once
 but i dont keep
felon, thief, pussy snitch bitches 
in my heart or my britches 
you live in a file 
dropped on the net 
for everyone and all to see
Your betrayal and dishonesty

Cause Robert Brooks is a bitch 

Seen my drones in the sky and my Dropcams in trees?
Did you notice gps pinging you incessantly 
The PI following you doing discovery 
You didn't?  Too busy living the life of a theif 
Eyes wide shut and mouth wide open 
you will always be at risk from "we"
Because youre a cretin and you do this chronically 
Remember Lee?  
Well I did, and I do, I don't duck responsibility 
Because I am a professional, 
I'm so good people pay me, I don't need guns 
While children like you lie and steal from my dad, 
well, I engineer theft from theives 
I'm going to be make you an exceptionally sad lad 

Cause Robert Brooks a bitch

Nigga you dumb, you fucked with a hacker
The pretty little world you created is for slackers
we were friends once I wanted you to succeed 
You are the reason I won't help friends in need 

I destroyed my lab to give you a place to sleep, 
Of friends who wouldn't violate their lease 
A, thief, pussy snitch bitch who caused a fire 
Helping a friend was my only desire 

Nigga bum 

I don't keep bitches
in my heart (no) you live in a file 
dropped on the net (yeah)
for anyone and all to see and me to forget 
So Die, leave, forever sleep 

Come fight me, I'll cut you at the knees, 
Make you punch up, bitch you'll be shorter than me
The life you lived taking advantage of these.
amazing how easy you gain deep enemies 

nigga bum

Traitor to your family, 
loser to your kids, 
sneaky coward yellow belly 
Sounds like a homegrown 
Benchmade bitch bitch bitch bitch

Hopalong have nothing be nothing bitch 
Left dad to die alone like a wretch 
Pussy ass bitch couldn't say bye to dad 
The only thing of value that he ever had 
The man still stands looking up at you, pussy 
You were too busy manipulating hussies

Nigga bum 

You can say sorry when you join him 
But You won't because 
you're a bitch you'll 
Shuffle past him quickly, 
looking at your feet 
Ain't got nothing not even honor, 
You're no man you're a monsterrrrrr
so let's ask RL Stine how your story ended 
with a dumb nigga dead lying in the street 

nigga bum 

Can't escape the prison of your mind bitch 
Cut your nipples off and stuff them in your eyes bitch 
Pay Tiny to rub your ass and let him go to town
till the frothy cum runs brown 
Get you some prison hepatitis 
evil kids like you deserve the virus 
no one but you suffers from the wackness you ride with 

Don't consider this payback for the life you lived for free 
Getting you off probation wasn't a donation 
So keep my name out your mouth unless you want my dick on your lips

you're a fatass bitch now ahahaha
